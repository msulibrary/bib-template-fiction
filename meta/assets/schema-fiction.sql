I try to wipe a stupid look of my face and respond, "I-I''m doing well, it''s a beautiful afternoon, you?"</p>\r\n<p>He sighs and combs his hand through his hair. </p> <p>"Nothing is getting done and I''m starting to lose it."</p>\r\n<p>"Well, what needs to be done?"</p>\r\n<p>The candle flickers a little more and I hope it doesn''t go out.</p>\r\n<p>"You don''t want to hear about that" he says through a smile. His teeth are very white but his mouth looks a little stained like he had a glass or \r\ntwo of red wine earlier. The portly, warted host comes with a glass of water and sets it down in front of me. He looks at the man in front of me for a moment, I expect him to say something. The man at my table has become occupied on his phone. I don''t say anything. The host lets out a breath and leaves. I haven''t looked at the menu yet. The man picks up and takes a sip from the glass of water. He drinks too fast and a little bit of water drips down his chin. His lips look a little purple</p>\r\n<p>"Grapefruit?" I say loudly startling a couple people around us including myself. Why did I say that? The wax of the candle is slightly whiter than the table cloth. I think this man ate my grapefruit.</p>\r\n<p>"What?" the man looks confused. "What about grapefruit?"</p>\r\n<p>I am thinking off the time when he was a boy and ate a grapefruit I had cut in half for myself for breakfast. I noticed I was missing one of my shirt buttons so I left the kitchen to grab another shirt. His face was still covered in juice when I came back in. I was mad. I asked him why he ate it when he knew it was mine. He said he was sorry and that he was hungry but that just made me madder and I knew I was going to be late now. I picked up one of the empty grapefruit halves and asked him again why he ate it. Before he could answer I shoved the fruit into his mouth and told him never to eat what is not his again. When I threw away the rind I told him he had made me late again. I wasn''t late though. I showed up to work on time that day. I was still fired a month later though.</p>\r\n<p>We are still sitting at the table when I start to cry. Underneath the table I can feel that grapefruit juice and his saliva on my hands, dry but still sticky.</p>\r\n<p>My mouth opens and closes a couple times before I can let out any words. I think I tell him I am sorry and he can have as much of the food in the house as he wants and that he shouldn''t be afraid of me and nothing was his fault. He is talking to me though and he looks concerned. He\r\ntouches my shoulder and speaks calmly but his voice is a little unsteady. He repeats something to me but I can''t tell what it means and forget it anyway. Only a couple tears came out of my eyes and I wipe them away. This man across from me doesn''t have a plate and the table only has one menu, he must not be eating anything tonight. Neither of us say anything for a while. Then he blinks a couple times and shifts in his chair.</p>\r\n<p>"I think it''s probably best" He says.</p>\r\n<p>The red curtains and wooden walls make me feel like I am backstage in an old theatre. The candle in front of me is flickering like a stage light telling me to exit.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>I am sitting at a small table in a restaurant that smells like fish.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Flashback (narrative)', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),

I mean was it always so miserable looking or did we do that?"</P>\r\n<p>That must have been a rhetorical question because she kept talking without waiting for an answer. That''s ok though, I didn''t really have an answer for her. I never thought of Earth''s color that much, it looked\r\nthe same blue it always did to me. Maybe we just like to think of it as a brilliantly deep, shining diamond or something, because if that pale dot is our mother, well our mother isn''t too awe inspiring.</P>\r\n<p>J kept going on about what she did on Earth before the move and how each breath felt when you were hiking or how the ocean felt and how the sun used to burn her even though she kind of liked the feeling.

Sorry."</p>\r\n<p>"Kwei have you ever been skiing?" J overemphasized every syllable  to make it sound like she was talking to a slow person. "You know down a hill. Swish, Swish. Making little s''s all the way to the bottom."</p>\r\n<p>"Oh no. Have you?"</p>\r\n<p>J gave me a kinda half funny, half terrifying glare for a moment before she sighed and said in a small voice "no, I don''t think anyone here has." We sat in silence for a while before J regained her energy and started ranting about how if there were only snow, there would be perfect skiing here.</p>\r\n<p>"Look how tall these mountains are! You could ski forever, just keep falling and falling and by the time you reach the bottom you''d have been going for so long you would be ready for a break. I bet the mountains would be a lot prettier with some snow too. I am so sick of all this red. It''s suffocating you know. I really can''t breathe. This is just gasping. Can you breathe Kwei?" no j i cannot breathe no one can breathe count every breath and enjoy every sensation I know it doesn''t compare to before the move  but it''s the greatest luxury and the rarest commodity i love you j and when i see you for the last time please don''t cry it will be easier for you and for me because i know when you were crying it wasn''t for you and it wasn''t for me but j we are just mammals with hair and skin and blood and milk and i know you always told me there is no use crying for spilled milk or however it went j but don''t cry for them they are unborn they are spared and they are the lucky cry for me instead j cry for your mother who didn''t make it through the move and cry for yourself j because you deserve better j you don''t deserve this</p>\r\n<p>But I didn''t say that. Instead I laughed, it was a sincere laugh at least but I laughed at J. I laughed at the red mountains and what they would   look like covered in snow, I laughed at a J covered in knit snow gear with poles and skis and a stocking cap ready to go down the hill, I laughed at the empty snow chairs left on Earth left to endlessly sway back and forth in the wind, I laughed at how dramatic J could be about being pent up behind the glass walls every day and I laughed to keep myself from feeling sad that I will never be able to ski. I will never spend the day in some alps with good friends and enjoy a hot drink in a mug when the night comes and relax and think about how great the day was or even take it for granted. Soon enough J was laughing too, and I don''t know what exactly she was laughing about but it made us both feel better. The green light on the water pump changed to blue and we both drank as much as we could. We threw rocks  at the trunk of the tree closest to the alfalfa squares until J went back to the women''s dorm.</p>\r\n<p>J and I used to call the tree by the alfalfa squares, Big Green. There weren''t many people our age in the dome because not many children survived or were allowed on the Move. It was supposed to be easier to sustain the initial group if there were less children. but that was almost twenty years ago. There are other members of our generation but I don''t  see much of them, only J. A couple times the two of us would meet under Big Green -instead of going to Sustained Life training- and make up stories about how Big Green got to the dome from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Standing alone next to the tree I felt incredibly small. I knelt down at Green''s trunk and started to dig my hands into the dirt as deep as I could get them, deep enough to start to feel the roots. I grabbed onto a root and held it firmly. The dirt began to feel like loose flesh. Just three days ago I thought. My fingers began to tighten on the boney root.</p>\r\n<p>:::::</p>\r\n<p>Leader Marcell is crying into my shoulder.

Leader Marcell and I are standing in the room we use to  help monitor and take care of the bacteria tanks. The tanks give the whole\r\nspace a rich blue coating that shifts with the slow artificial movement of the water. I bet J would like this room, it might remind her of Earth and what a good deep blue looks like these days. J isn''t allowed in this room though and has never seen the tanks. Leader Marcell is talking again and I am too numb to respond, I can only think of what J would think of this room if she could see it.</p>\r\n<p>We are running out of oxygen. This is what Leader Marcell is trying  to tell me. The dome was initially set up to support a population our size maybe even a little bit bigger, but we got the balance wrong. We moved too quickly with not enough time to plan and set up. We didn''t have enough research to go on, we didn''t know enough about supplying oxygen to an environment and a population like this. We are going to die. We are going to suffocate. Leader Marcell is worried that the move was pointless and that everything is pointless.

Three days after learning about my upcoming death, the death of every human being and the death of J, I am holding as tight as I can onto the roots of Big Green and I am crying.

I am thinking of Big Green and wondering what will happen to this giant, dumb tree when J and I aren''t here to throw stones at it. I am thinking of the slower suffocation that Big Green will experience when the nutrient pumps under the soil run dry. I am thinking about how dumb it is to cry for a tree right now.

(20, 'A World Apart', 'Brady Jensen', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>The sun was falling into the west, and after it left, it would become unbearably cold. The Bridgers were peaked with snow though it had not reached down into the valley yet. Paul just stood, leaned against his\r\nFord Explorer, watching the world move on around him, pretending that he was not caught up in time with everything else. Perhaps, this was his final attempt to hang onto the warmer months before the Montana winter would sweep in and cover everything in a layer of snow and ice.</p>\r\n<p>He could not see the highway, though he could hear the "hum"   and "swoosh" of the occasional car that would fly by in the unknown. He lived not far away, on the edge of a town called Bozeman, which somehow managed to be both a small town and city at the same time. He knew it  was a short distance between his home and where he now stood, perhaps, not more than five miles difference, maybe seven, but that short drive  made all the difference. Here, in this other world, he often drove to fish the Gallatin, or to just sit and listen, or, maybe, if it felt right, to talk.</p>\r\n<p>He felt foolish the first time he had done it: just started talking to no one. It was only a word or two, perhaps some exclamation that caught him unawares. The sound of his voice spooked him as if he were\r\nan animal, and he retreated back into silence. Weeks later, though, after he returned one evening just to watch the river pass by, he opened his mouth and a few words quietly escaped. It was hardly more than a mumble\r\nbut it forced him to turn around and make sure no one was watching or listening. After that, things kind of took off. He would spend hours talking; he would talk until his throat was sore or until he simply ran\r\nout of words to say. His mundane life created little more than mundane problems, but these he saved up during the days or weeks leading up to his next visit and, once there, he would tell his stories and problems to the river that ran below him, whose edge he would sometimes cross, fly-rod in hand, to participate in the holy act of fly-fishing; he would rant to the foothills that skirted the mountains and on which, just before the sun would set, he could watch the animals come out to feed: deer and elk, a small orange fox, or a grey flash on the tree-line which he thought was a wolf, but was more likely a coyote; lastly, he talked to the mountains. He never knew why, but always had to work his way up to addressing these lithic beasts, coated in pine and bespeckled by rock slides and cliffs where the earth''s integrity itself was tested. For these mountains, monuments\r\nto a god unknown, for these alone, he saved his deepest concerns and his\r\nmost philosophical thoughts that every human is bound to stumble upon in his life. Many an evening, he sat on the bank of the river, eyes fixed on  a single tree, miles and miles away, or roving from peak to peak, and asked the mountains why they exist, why he exists. He would face them with\r\nthe problems of a mortal life: of love and why he hated spending nights alone; of death and why he must sit by and watch his friends and family part from him into the abyss. He would ask the mountains how it felt to watch civilizations rise and fall and about the countless lives that have been lost at their very feet and on their very faces. The mountains were Paul''s confidants and knew his deepest secrets.</P>\r\n<p>On one of these evenings, sitting on the bank of the river, Paul had extolled his frustrations with his job and with women and with the world, upon the river and the foothills when he finally looked towards the mountains.\r\n<p>"Well?" he said with a sigh as he looked for something more to say, as if to humor them.</p>\r\n<p>Paul''s eyes became fixed on a point of the mountainside nearest him. His mind went blank, and he stared as if he was drawn to the point by some divine power. The point was simple, a single tree in the sea of pine, little more than a drop of water in the ocean. Slowly, as he allowed himself to surrender to the mountain and the moment, to allow his mind to remain blank, did he begin to understand. The mountains were speaking to him. All this time, not only had Paul been talking, but the mountains had been listening, and now, it was their turn to speak. Paul remained motionless, eyes fixed on the single tree, which seemed as ordinary as every other\r\ntree around it, but was, somehow, more. At this time, this single tree was portal that could link Paul''s mind with something greater, something unimaginably profound, and something unquestionably pure.</p>\r\n<p>Now, it was Paul''s turn to listen, to look up at these pillars raised  to the sky and to hear their words. Paul sat for hours before he realized that the mountains'' words were not words at all. By a transference of divine feeling, from them, unto him, he felt the presence of the mountains. Perhaps these symbols, these ideas, were simply realizations-a grand unification of signifier and signified. Perhaps it was something greater: perhaps these were the words of God. This transference of ideas, of concepts, of answers, continued well past the setting of the sun to when Paul could no longer see the point at which he stared, but felt were it was by the unmistakable hold it had on his gaze.</p>\r\n<p>As mysteriously as it had begun, it ended. His attention was drawn\r\nto the"hum" and "swoosh" of a car speeding into the headlit dark. It was the first one he had heard all night. He simply sat in the grass, where he had been for hours and tried to make sense of what had happened. The mountains'' voice, if it can even be called that, still sounded in his mind. It echoed in the recesses of his brain; its vastness was astounding and consumed him. His limbs had grown cold and stiff as if the earth had imbibed him and, now, offered him up once more to the world of man, only more stone than flesh and bone. Slowly, he shook himself free from the stupor, feeling the dust of crumbling stone fall from his joints to rejoin the earth, and moved back towards his Ford Explorer.</p>\r\n<p>He returned one week later. He had spent the past seven days trying to understand what had happened, but to no avail. He felt himself fundamentally changed; though, in all ways he could inspect, he was very much the same. As he approached the river''s edge and scanned its water and the foothills and the mountains, they too seemed, somehow, changed, though he could not quite identify what was different. He examined the river. It flowed as steady as ever over the free stones. He examined the foothills. The fields of grass remained; some contained cattle, others, a few deer that had ventured out; nothing seemed out of place. He examined the mountains. The layer of pines was as green as ever, the cliffs and rockslides were very much as he had left them. He stepped back and viewed all three at once and still, he could not help but to feel that the scene, that he, that the world was changed. He closed his eyes and removed himself from\r\nthe scene entirely, back to the last week when his eyes had been fixed on the point of the mountainside. Immediately, he opened his eyes and tried to find the point that had captivated him the week before, but, try as he might, he could not find it. He even walked to where he had sat, in the grass on the river''s bank, but even from there, he could not find the single tree that seemed to stand out so singularly the week before. He stared at the wooded hillside when a spark was lit inside his head. "It is simply a mountain," he thought to himself. "What do mountains care the troubles of the world? for my troubles? for other mountains?" This is what the mountain had taught him: mountains will be mountains, neither more nor less. The mountains had listened to his words and his problems and they gave him a glimpse into a moment of being a mountain; the lives of mountains are slow, incomprehensibly slow. Ice ages come and go under their watches; Man has fallen from Grace under their gaze and fallen  even further than could have been imagined and, still, the mountains carry on. The rivers and the foothills are nothing more than products of the mountains: their children, their progeny, their legacy. This man, this mortal of mortals, and his problems, spouted at the world and heard by   the mountains, was given an insight into the nature of the mountains, and the world, and life and he realized that all his problems were not problems, but were barely even trifles. In the past week, what had changed was that he had not developed a list of complaints for the river and foothills and the mountains, and, without those problems dragged into this world apart, he could simply sit and contemplate his life, or the mountains''.</P>\r\n<p>When the sun finally disappeared into the West, Paul was still leaned against the Explorer. His eyes were fixed on the mountainside and he had something of a half-smile on his face as the cold began to nip at his nose and fingertips. Several years had come and gone since his revelation, and still, he comes to this spot nearly every week, though, now, few words need be spoken. He sits quietly for hours, listening to the stories of the mountains and, only on the rarest of occasions, sharing his own. His  stories are not new to the mountains, but are tales that they have heard more times that Paul could ever know. The mountains know that the world is only recycled, and stories are no different. Perhaps the mountains once told the original story: the story of the world. But now, under the light of a simple yellow sun, all stories are only retold, and the mountains listen and care not, for they know the only story that matters.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Awe', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
(21, 'The Man Formerly of 34C', 'Brady Jensen', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>There once was a man who lived in 34C. Of all the places in the city that he could have lived, he liked 34C the best. 34C was located on the top floor of a building on the Upper East Side and was made all the more enjoyable because 34A and 34B had been empty since before the man moved in and had remained empty since. The man fancied himself the king over the entire empire of the 34th floor, though he was the quietest king that ever lived. He often spent his days alone in his apartment reading a book in the light of the single window, turning the pages furiously, his eyes set ablaze by the friction of the words that passed so rapidly beneath them.</p>\r\n<p>When he was a younger man, the man of 34C would venture out to used-book stores throughout the city, looting shelves and bringing his plunder up to his apartment, lining the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling. But as he became older, and leaving his apartment became more of a chore, he began having his books delivered to his door. He remembered the first book-shaped package arrived, wrapped in plastic  and ready to be consumed. From that day, he ordered books by the dozen, ordering and ordering and all the while reading them as fast as he could.</p>\r\n<p>The man of 34C read novels, new and old; he read through volumes of poetry-he knew the classics well. He read short stories and novellas-introductions and prefaces and prologues and afterwards and epigraphs and thank-yous. Books were his food and water, his shelter, his bed, his air.</p>\r\n<p>As the years past, the man of 34C''s apartment became quite full of books. His shelves no longer housed only single rows, but instead held legions two or three rows deep. Around the bottom of each shelf, piles began to form, and after they had formed, they grew and grew until each pile had merged with those around it and created a mountain of books, burying the base of the shelf, leaving only the top protruding like the peak of a mountain. As the piles grew, the man remained seated near the window, letting the light from the sun shine on the open pages he held in his hands. The books endowed the man of 34C with a kind of energy that allowed him to read for days on end without looking up. After three or four days had passed and the floor around him was piled with books that he had read without moving, he would close the book he had just finished, set it on the pile at his feet, and walk to the door where would be waiting five or six boxed piled on top of each other and each filled to the top with books. He would drag the boxes into the apartment, empty them , and leave them back out in the hallway to be taken away. After he had unloaded the loot he would sit for a minute and bask in the glory of  the delivery before he would take the books that had piled around his feet, return them to another pile near one of the bookshelves, and, with his arms full of books, he would return once more to his seat near the window and bury himself in their pages.</p>\r\n<p>Time passed and this routine continued. The bookshelves became lost; entire rooms of the apartment were filled floor to ceiling, unenterable, every inch occupied and some even spilling out of the door. In all the corners were piles, where some of the most brilliant tales of bravery and tragedy and romance, or some of the most elegant verses that language has ever seen, were lost in these eternal piles. The path from the window seat to the door was the only open space, though to make it from one to the other, the man must step on some of the books that now began to slide off the piles and cobble the path. Hundreds of thousands of books, millions  of pages, and billions of words found a home in this place, and more arrived every day. Boxes continued to be piled at the door surrounded by individually wrapped stragglers shipped from rare-book vendors. The man continued to bring these packages through the door, welcoming them into his home, piling them wherever he could find the space. The corners were full, the kitchen and bedroom, packed solid, the hallway, impassible. When the latest group of boxes were emptied and placed in the living-area, he turned back to his apartment; the window that now provided the only light to the room was nearly covered, the small opening allowed light to  fall only on the book that he held in his hands. It was difficult to place his body on the seat without blocking the window entirely.</p>\r\n<p>Several days later, there was a knock on the door as the packages were delivered. The man of 34C rearranged himself and moved towards the door. Stepping carefully over the piles that had formed overnight on the path to the door. Outside, there were three boxes. He looked around to make sure that no one was watching. He opened the boxes there in the hallway for there was no room to bring an entire box into the apartment; like all the other boxes before, these were full, testing the structural integrity of the boxes that contained them. One by one he removed the books, embracing each in its turn, carefully, caressing it, feeling its worn pages, breathing its alluring smell, and bringing it back into his dark, cavernous apartment. He carried the last book of the boxes back to his seat, shuffling to make it through the tiny column that was barely large \r\nenough to allow him to squeeze through. The floor of the apartment strained audibly under the weight of the man and his books. The entire room had become filled; the only place left was the seat where he sat and room enough for this final book. The man of 34C took his seat, his body filling the space perfectly; the light was gone, the window was entirely packed with books. His body filled the space, and the room was finally full.</p>\r\n<p>At that moment, something happened. If there was a flash or  some grand gesture, nothing escaped 34C. Where the man had been, there remained nothing but books, and on the very top of the pile was a single book. Its cover was blank; it had not been ordered; no one had seen it before; no one had read it before. And no one ever heard from the man formerly of 34C.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Bibliophilia', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en');

My dad said I look so handsome with a tie on that all the girls are gonna want to be my girlfriend." It was Ian''s turn for pictures so he took off his glasses and asked Bobby to hold onto them.</p>\r\n<p>As Ian got his picture taken, Bobby read the paper everyone was writing on. "Miss Thomas'' Class - Grade 2." He picked up the pencil  and wrote his name under Ian''s. Robert Parish. Ian came back and got his glasses, and Bobby walked under the photographer''s bright lights. He sat on the stool and straightened his back up right. When the flash lit up his sweater, Bobby''s smile was bigger than ever.</p>\r\n<p>Still smiling, Bobby stepped out from the lights and walked to Ian who was standing in a new line. "Those lights are hot!" he said. I''m already sweating."</p>\r\n<p>"Me too," Ian said motioning to his armpits. "You can see it through my shirt." After Bobby stopped looking, Ian closed his arms tighter to his body than usual.</P>\r\n<p>"I hope we get to stand together," Bobby said. "How tall are you?" "4'' 3""</p>\r\n<p>"Me too."</p>\r\n<p>All of the kids had finished getting their pictures taken and were standing in the new line. There was a new photographer who, with the help of Miss Thomas, was walking down the line picking out the tallest students,followed by the shorter ones. This took a few minutes and when the order was set, the photographer led the line to a small set of bleachers three steps high. The tallest boys took their places at the top and the rest of\r\nthe children followed after. Bobby and Ian were in the middle of the second highest step and they were standing together. Bobby smiled a little when he realized Maria was standing almost right in front of him.</p>\r\n<p>"I think these lights are even brighter than the other ones," Bobby\r\nsaid.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m sweating again." Ian lifted his arms and smelled his armpits; his nose wrinkled. "I stink!" Bobby laughed really loudly. Ian laughed too and put his arms back tightly against his side.</p>\r\n<p>Bobby was waiting quietly for the photographer to get ready when he heard the conversation of the boys behind him. They were whispering but he could hear them talking about his "ugly sweater" and the "stains all over it." Bobby looked down at his sweater and all of the sudden the lights got even hotter. He kept waiting for the photographer.</p>\r\n<p>"I can''t believe Maria likes him," one of the boys said. They were talking louder now and Bobby could hear them clearly.</p>\r\n<p>"Do you think he ever washes that thing?" another boy asked.</p>\r\n<p>Bobby turned around and looked up at the two boys who were talking about him. They both smiled and one said "Hi, Bobby."</p>\r\n<p>"Hi." Bobby turned back around. He realized that the two boys who were talking about him were wearing dress shirts and ties. He turned around again to the other side and looked at everyone else who was standing on the top row. Most all of them were wearing ties too.</p>\r\n<p>"Look at all the holes," one of the boys said.</p>\r\n<p>Bobby''s sweater started to feel really tight and itchy. He clawed at the turtleneck and stretched it out. Now he could breathe a little better. The photographer was almost ready to take the picture when Bobby leaned over to Ian and whispered "The boys behind us are making fun of me."</p>\r\n<p>"What are they saying?"</p>\r\n<p>"They''re talking about my sweater."</p>\r\n<p>"You''ve just got to ignore them," Ian said. He took off his glasses and put them into his pocket. "Just ignore them."</p>\r\n<p>As the photographer counted to three everyone posed and smiled. Bobby''s smile was really big and when he started thinking about Maria''s smile it grew even bigger. He liked her smile a lot. The flash went off and the moment was captured; the photographer wanted to take one more picture.</P>\r\n<p>"I bet he''ll wear it forever."</p>\r\n<p>The photographer was ready for the next picture. "One...Two..." Everyone smiled. Bobby''s smile was smaller than before but still pretty big. Bigger than the other boys''. "Three." The flash went off for the last time.</p>\r\n<p>The class started to file off of the bleachers and Bobby''s row had to wait for the other rows to leave. The girls who were standing on the floor started the line. Bobby was still sweating under the bright lights and   Maria''s row started to file out. When Maria started to walk away, Bobby reached out to the middle of her back and snapped the strap of her training bra. All of the boys around Bobby, including the two behind him and Ian, laughed really hard and Maria yelled "Hey!" as she turned around. Bobby was giggling and staring off into space as though he never noticed what happened. All the other boys were laughing and Maria slapped Bobby on the arm and said "Bobby!" She was pretty mad, but the way she slapped  him on the arm, Bobby knew she wasn''t too mad.</p>\r\n<p>As she walked away and Bobby''s row began to fall into line, Ian put on his glasses. Bobby moved his hand subtly toward Ian and Ian slapped it with a loud low-5.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>When Bobby got home from school he spent a long time in the bathroom. There was a long mirror on the back of the door and he was standing in front of it. He was looking at his sweater and turning left and right. He spun in a circle and when he faced the mirror again he adjusted his collar-it was stretched more than usual.</p>\r\n<p>Bobby''s sweater was a faded red turtleneck. It had grass stains all over and food stains on the front. It had three small holes along the bottom\r\nand a big rip in the back from his first attempt at a backflip from the swings. The sweater fit Bobby almost perfectly-the sleeves came right to his hands, the turtleneck wasn''t too tight, and the fabric fell just the right amount over his belt. Bobby kept looking at his sweater with squinted eyes and a crunched nose. Finally, he lifted it up and over his head. He hadn''t seen his bare skin since summer vacation and he felt a little naked. Very naked. He looked at his chest in the mirror nearly an hour-turning and spinning, squinting and crunching.</p>\r\n<p>Later, Bobby opened the bathroom door and walked down the hall to his dad''s office. Mr. Parish was wearing a dress shirt and black tie, and he was finishing some work he brought home from the office.</p>\r\n<p>When Bobby came in, Mr. Parish looked very pleasantly surprised.</p>\r\n<p>"Bobby! You took off your sweater. What gives, little man?"</p>\r\n<p>"It got too small. I don''t fit into it anymore," Bobby said. "Can you \r\nteach me how to tie a tie? I want to wear a tie."Mr. Parish smiled. He didn''t expect to be asked that for a long time. "My son''s growing up," he said.</p>\r\n<p."But I don''t want to wear a plain tie," Bobby said. "I want to wear a tie with rocketships."</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Peer Pressure', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
(23, 'Burried', 'Conor Munion', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>Brendan Collins sat by the fireplace smoking a pipe. The sun set through a window behind him. "Radio said there was another bombing today," he said to his wife, Aofie.</p>\r\n<p>She looked up with worry in her eyes, brow knit as tight as the half- finished scarf in her hands. "Oh dear," she whispered. "How horrible."</p>\r\n<p."Aye," Brendan said. "Two police officers were killed. And a young lad, too. They think he was playing under the car when it went off."</p>\r\n<p>Aofie made a distressed sound, the tragedy too great for words.\r\nNight approached and the light left the tired land. Brendan smoked his pipe and stared into the hearth. Aofie lay her knitting down.</p>\r\n<p>"Should I make the din, Bren?" she asked. Her husband continued staring into the flames. "Bren?"</p>\r\n<p>He blinked and looked over. "What''s that, love?"	She smiled patiently, stood, and kissed his cheek. "Sometimes I worry there''s too much goin'' on here," she said, pointing to his head. "Someday you''ll get so lost in thought you won''t be able t''find your way home!"</p>\r\n<p>He took her hand and kissed it. "Don''t worry, m''dear. I''m just an old man reflectin'' on his days. Now, what did ye ask?"</p>\r\n<p>"Should I get the din ready?" He nodded. "A fine idea."</p>\r\n<p>She squeezed his hand and went to the kitchen. Brendan put out his pipe and settled in his chair, eyes closed...\r\n<p>Banging on the door. Loud, impatient.</p> <p>Brendan opened his eyes and coughed.</p> <p>More banging.</p>\r\n<p>"Could you get that, Bren?" Aofie called from the kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>"Aye, aye, just give me a moment t''move me old bones." Brendan rose. He winced at arthritis pains and walked to the door. It was full dark now, though the half-moon still shed some light. Brendan turned on the front porch light and peered through the door window.</p>\r\n<p>His mouth dropped. He blinked and stared for an astonished moment.</p>\r\n<p>Then he groaned in dismay.</p>\r\n<p>He opened the door. A hooded man stood outside, shifting anxiously in the dim light. He grinned wide at Brendan, crooked teeth peeking out from a big, salt-and-pepper beard. "Brother!" he cried. He held out his arms in embrace.</p>\r\n<p>Brendan crossed his. "What''re you doin'' here, Felix?""Just stoppin'' by to see me kin, that''s what."</p>\r\n<p>"I doubt that. What kind o'' trouble are you in now?"</p>\r\n<p>Felix dropped his arms. "I thought you''d be glad t''see me."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan scoffed. "As glad as I''d be t''see the Devil himself at me door.\r\nYou are here for some trouble, aye?"</p>\r\n<p>Felix scratched at his beard. "Well...aye."</p>\r\n<p>"Does it have anythin'' to do with that bomb as went off this mornin''?"\r\nFelix stuffed his hands in his trenchcoat. "No, no," he reassured. "Well aye, t''is." Brendan started closing the door. "But not how you think! I swear!" He blocked the door with his boot. The two brothers stared at each other.</p>\r\n<p>Brendan sighed and shook his head. "Close on ten years without a word and now you come to me? I didn''t even know you still drew breath, Felix. Would it have killed you to send a letter?"</p>\r\n<p>"I wasn''t really in a place t''be sendin'' letters." Felix chuckled nervously. "Damn loyalists had me in hidin'' for a long while."</p>\r\n<p>"Only yourself to blame for that. What is it you need from me and me wife?"</p>\r\n<p>"Just t''stay the night. I''ll be out before the morn, promise." Brendan eyed his brother with suspicion. "Please, Bren," Felix pleaded. "Just do me this one thing and I''ll shove off for good."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan didn''t say anything for a long time. Then he closed his eyes and dropped his head. "I''m a fool," he muttered. He turned to Aofie, who had been watching cautiously from the threshold. "We''d better set another place at the table."</p>\r\n<p>The table was set. Felix sat on one side, Brendan and Aofie on the other. A steaming shepherd''s pie lay between them.</p>\r\n<p>"Smells like a wonderful feast, Aofie," Felix said.</p>\r\n<p>"Why thank you," she replied, not meeting his eye.</p>\r\n<p>"May I say grace over it?"\r\nAofie glanced at her husband. "Of course."</p>\r\n<p>The three joined hands and bowed their heads.</p>\r\n<p>"Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about t''receive from your bounty through Christ, our Lord. Amen."</p>\r\n<p>"Amen," the other two muttered.</p>\r\n <p>Brendan served portions of the pie without a word. Felix set on his like he''d been starved for a week, sparing no modesty in devouring the meal. He asked for a second serving and ate that almost as quickly. Brendan watched him with concern, barely touching his food. After they had finished, Aofie cleared the plates and started washing them in the adjoined kitchen.Brendan cleared his throat. "You would''ve heard about Mary, then?"</p>\r\n<p>"Aye," Felix said.</p>\r\n<p>"We missed you at the funeral. Thought maybe you''d show up to see her off, at least."</p>\r\n<p>Felix said nothing. The pain on his face was plain enough to see.</p> \r\n<p> "I''m sorry, Felix. I didn''t mean to-"</p>\r\n<p>"No," Felix said. "You''re right. I should''ve been there. She deserved a better brother."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan inclined his head. "She''d call your name in her sleep, y''know.\r\nAlways said you''d come for her. ''Any day now,'' she''d say. ''Any day.''"</p>\r\n<p>Felix turned his head to hide his tears. He sniffed and wiped his eyes. When he turned back to his brother his smile was a bitter one. "She''ll do better now, I think. No demons t''haunt her behind them Pearly Gates."</p>\r\n<p>"True," Brendan said. He paused. "I''m afraid we''ll miss ye there, too."</p> \r\n<p>"Oh, I know I done wrong in my time, brother. At least I done somethin'' t''all."</p>\r\n<p>"Like blowin'' up that young lad this mornin''?" "I told you I had nothin'' to do with that."</p>\r\n<p>"You said you''re here on account of it."</p>\r\n<p>Felix grimaced. "Aye. Some young punks in the Army, more gangsters than not."</p>\r\n<p>"Sounds familiar."</p>\r\n<p>He ignored the comment. "Bastards had no sense. Got themselves caught already, I gather. Prob''ly spillin'' their guts about me and the others right now."</p>\r\n<p>"So you had to run."</p>\r\n<p>"That''s right."</p>\r\n<p>"How d''you know they won''t search for you here?"</p>\r\n<p>Felix gave a rueful smile. "Everyone knows we don''t get on. I''m surprised you let me in, t''be honest."</p>\r\n<p>"Not as surprised as me," Brendan replied. The hint of a smile touched his lips. "Fancy a dram o'' whiskey?"</p>\r\nFelix laughed. "As if it were a question."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan fetched the two glasses and whiskey from the kitchen. He poured each a finger and sat by Felix.</p>\r\n<p>Brendan raised his glass. Sl&aacute;inte."</p>\r\n<p>"Sl&aacute;inte!"</p>\r\n<p>The two drank. Felix coughed a fit into his sleeve, his eyes watering.</p> <p>"Don''t tell me you''ve gone soft," joked Brendan. "Haven''t had a proper\r\ndrink in near a decade," Felix croaked.</p>\r\n<p>That amused Brendan. "The way I remember it, you could out-drink a fish if you had to."</p>\r\n<p>"Oh, aye. You remember that time down at the Old Dog-" </p>\r\n<p>"O''Riley''s place, aye?"</p>\r\n<p>Felix nodded and grinned. "Old man O''Riley and that damn ridiculous hat of his."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan''s eyes lit up. "You''re talkin'' about the night you stole it, aye?" "Aye! Stole the damn floppy thing right from his head!"</p>\r\n<p>"And he started chasin'' you around, everyone cheerin'' and all. Jumpin'' up on tables, runnin'' across the bar, all with that hat in one hand and a pint in the other!"</p>\r\n<p>Felix leaned forward as if to share a secret. "It was a fair chase, y''know, him bein'' so old and me bein'' so drunk!"</p>\r\n<p>The two laughed and laughed until their faces turned red and tears came to their eyes.</p>\r\n<p>"As I recall," Felix said, breathless, "you''re the one who got me home that night. God knows I couldn''t do it meself."</p>\r\n<p>"Someone''s got to look after you." Brendan smiled and the two exchanged a fond look.</p>\r\n<p>The brothers had another drink. They told more tales, reminiscing about their time spent together as young men. Brendan didn''t ask of Felix''s whereabouts. And Felix, for his part, brought no end to the boyhood stories of countless shared adventures. It was easy for them to forget what came after that, to focus only on the memories of unity rather than separation. Aofie came and joined them, listening with a smile to stories of her husband she never would have heard otherwise, blushing with embarrassment at times.</p>\r\n<p>After a while, the two fell into a content silence, each reflecting on their past.</p>\r\n<p>Felix laid his hands on the table. "There''s somethin'' else," he said.</p> <p>"Aye?"</p>\r\n<p>"I''m leavin'' the country."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan gave a resigned nod. "I figured as much." </p>\r\n<p>"I need to leave a few things here before I go." </p> \r\n<p>Brendan''s eyes narrowed. "What things?"</p>\r\n<p>Felix avoided his brother''s gaze. </p>\r\n"Guns."</p>\r\n<p>A moment of white-knuckled silence passed.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m glad you came to see me," Brendan said, his tone even. "But don''t think you can use that to bring us down with you. We won''t have your damn weapons in this house."</p>\r\n<p>"They won''t be in the house," Felix replied quickly. "I''ll bury them out back."</p>\r\n<p>"Like all hell you will," Brendan growled. "I thought maybe you''d changed, Felix, but now I see you''re the same as you ever were. Gettin'' in trouble and expectin'' me to bale you out."</p>\r\n<p>"They''ll be here all o'' two weeks, Bren," Felix reassured. "Just enough time for things to quiet down, then some lads''ll come to take ''em back."\r\n"To hell with your guns!" Brendan shouted. He rose from the table, clenching his hands into fists. Aofie sat with her eyes downcast, hands folded in her lap. "Bury them somewhere else. Or toss ''em in the river for all I care."</p>\r\n<p>Felix shook his head. "They''re my way out. Payment to the Army for safe passage out o'' this country. Nothin''s free, brother."</p>\r\n<p>"So you came here and thought to involve us in your deal with the Devil!?" In three angry steps he reached for the phone and began dialing.</p>\r\n<p>A look of terror passed across Felix''s face. "What''re you doin''?"</p>\r\n<p>"Callin'' the police."</p>\r\n<p>Felix jumped to his brother''s side and snatched the phone away. "You can''t! They''d put me to death, Bren."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan''s eyes filled with contempt. <p>"It''s all you deserve."</p>\r\n<p>Felix gasped as if he''d been stabbed. "You don''t mean that."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan didn''t budge.</p>\r\n<p>"I''m your brother!" Felix begged. "Your own flesh and blood! All I need is this one favor, then I''ll be gone for good. You can scratch my face from the pictures and strike my name from the papers, but just help me leave. Help me live."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan didn''t reply. He paced the dining room. Aofie and Felix watched him, not daring even to twitch. The moment hung suspended in time, a breathless eternity. Brendan stopped pacing and stared out the back window which afforded a view of the field behind the Collins'' house.</p>\r\n<p>"Fine," Brendan said eventually. <p>"Because you''re my brother. But not after tonight."</p>\r\n<p>Felix sighed relief. "Thanks, Bren."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan stacked the washed dishes neatly in the cupboard while he\r\nwatched Felix dig a hole under moonlight in the field behind the house. Aofie embraced her husband and whispered, "At least it''s over now. No more worryin'' about him."</p>\r\n<p>Brendan said nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Weeks passed, then months and years, and Felix''s lads never came for the guns. They remain buried on the Collins'' property to this day.</p>\r\n<p>No one knows where Felix Collins is buried.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', ' Sl&aacute;inte', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
(24, 'Phaethon', 'Autumn', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>The soil was rich, a dark, dark brown that reminded Rowan of coffee grounds.\r\n<p>She dug her hands into it, feeling the moist earth sift through her fingers and against her palms. The smell of coffee in her memory mingled with the scent of earth; she could see the cup of it in her boyfriend''s hand, and the blankets in the other, the streetlights casting stark pools of light in the parking lot. He smelled of coffee, he always did. She had held onto to him tightly, inhaling his scent, trying to cleanse herself of that sterile white smell that clung to her like a disease.\r\n<p>Her hands tightened around the earth and she drew back, touching  the leaves of the small potted aspen next to her. To the left out of the corner of her eye, the large oak loomed. She tried not to look at it.\r\n<p>The park was abuzz that day; families flocked to the huge green of Tamarack with baby trees in their black plastic pots. Mothers held the hands of little toddlers who clutched green toy buckets and shovels, and fathers pushed back the brims of their baseball caps while they toted trees and tools, looking up at the sun as it climbed in the sky. The park''s Arbor Day celebration every year was a huge event in Terry, and it teemed with trees of various ages planted every year at the end of April. To Rowan, it was as large of a forest as she could find in eastern Montana, and she knew the best oaks to sit in with a book. "Your own little urban forest," her Dad always said, his eyes twinkling.\r\n<p>When was the last time they had done that?\r\n<p>Penny, who was six, was next to her, arms pushed into the ground all the way up to her elbows, watching her older sister. Her wide blue eyes blinked, red hair blowing around her face in the breeze. Her little willow sat beside Rowan''s aspen - the tree their mother had selected for her. The one her mother had asked her to plant on her behalf was a small\r\ncottonwood - funny, Rowan thought wryly, that she''d picked a cottonwood, what with her allergies and all. She used to fill burlap sacks with all the cotton that piled up under the patio table and in the corners of the fence to make pillows for her stories until Momma had apologetically thrown them, sneezing as she did.\r\n<p>She hadn''t come today, and neither had their father, who had muttered he didn''t want a tree and had gone into the garage. Penny and Rowan had left both of them near the driveway, where Shawn had always worked on his pickup.Rowan swallowed hard and stood, reaching to the fold-up shovel she''d thrown in the pack. The sound of it slicing through the earth was softened, as though the ground was hurrying to muffle it. The white noise of the people around them grated on her nerves. Couldn''t they all hear it? That horrific boom that the trees had done nothing to muffle?\r\n<p>Sometimes she thought she could hear his neck snap, like a sharp clap of thunder during the lightning storms he loved. That wasn''t possible.\r\n<p>Penny pulled both fists out of the dirt, itching at her cheek and leaving a smudge across her face; warrior stripes on an angel. "Can we plant mine first? Please Rowan?"\r\n<p>She smiled a half smile and nodded, tucking loose strands of auburn hair behind her ears. "Yeah, love. We can do that."\r\n<p>The rosebud of Penny''s mouth saddened a little as she watched her big sister dig. She wished she''d hum again while she worked, singing under her breath the way she always used to when she''d load the dishwasher or pull weeds in the garden.\r\n<p>Rowan stuck the shovel in the ground and got down on her knees, taking the willow and gently pulling it from the pot it rested in.\r\n<p>Shawn had teased her for how much she loved trees almost as much  as she poked at him for obsessing with machinery. He had always been in the garage, tinkering with whatever broken pickup or car was parked in the left side of the garage that Dad had designated "the Shop." Putting a lift on his pickup had been the latest thing, though they''d sold it to someone in Forsyth last month.\r\n<p>Rowan ran her hand over the thinness of its branches and its tiny trunk, looking at the white roots that ran through the small bit of attached soil. They looked like veins, pale and stark against the brown. She hurried to cover them, patting the soil in place quickly. The veins in his arms had been green and purple, vivid through his still, translucent skin.\r\n<p>Penny patted the soil, the dull thud of her little hands packing the tree in place. She smiled. "Next?"\r\n<p>The two sisters worked on their knees, until the three little ones stood newly grounded, cottonwood, aspen, and willow in a perfect line, facing the big oak.\r\n<p>They were so little, Rowan thought, and so young. Their branches were thin, their bark still supple, and they all reached for the sky in a child- like stretch that Rowan watched Penny do before running off to join the other younger kids spinning on the axis of the blue and white merry-go- round.\r\n<p>To this day, she didn''t know where the scream had come from. She''d looked at the accident, the mangled front end of the gray dodge accordioned into itself, the bits of glass crunching under her feet and sparkling obscenely in the ambulance light. She''d seen the open door of   the ambulance where she glimpsed the matted fluff of her brother''s black hair and heard her father saying, "I''m the father it''s ok" to the paramedic in the white latex gloves - she hated those powdered gloves so much - who was trying to stop him, and saw Penny''s face pressed against the window   of the car where she''d been told to stay, her face red in the neon lights that wouldn''t stop flashing, casting the scene into a bloody pall.\r\n<p>None of it was real. None of it could be - this was a scene from the movies she''d watched, these were the bad things that happened to other people on the evening news at night, while she was tucked away under the pages of her current book.\r\n<p>In the real world, Shawn would be sitting next to her on the grass  right now, waiting for them to be done planting and for Penny to be done playing and for Momma to be done talking to all the people she knew from church and for Dad to finish reading his book in the shade.\r\n<p>They would be staring at the rough bark of Rowan''s favorite oak''s trunk, wrinkled like the corners of the eyes of an old lady. She would be teasing him, and he would laugh that funny laugh where his voice would disappear that she''d been hearing for the last twenty years of her life, and his eyes would crinkle until he would say, "Ohhh man that''s funny." Fun- nay - that''s how he said it. But this wasn''t a real world anymore, and it hadn''t been for a year now.\r\n<p>Because Shawn had fallen asleep at 2:30 am on April tenth, at the wheel of their father''s Dodge.\r\n<p>He had driven off the road and slammed into that oak, where he had gone through the windshield and his neck had broken.\r\n<p>And he had never woken up in that white bed in the hospital where he''d been hooked up to all sorts of tubes and wires, his paper thin eyelids covering his brown eyes that none of them would ever see again.\r\n<p>All this left her staring at the trunk of the oak, the huge spot where  the pickup had torn its bark away and slashed deep scars into the wood. It''d been a year, so the color of the exposed part had darkened and deepened as though it was trying to camouflage the damage, but the scars were still as sharply horrific as Rowan remembered seeing that night.\r\n<p>She closed her eyes against the sirens and the flashing lights and the colors.\r\n<p>"Rowan?"She felt the touch of Penny''s hand on her shoulder. Turning\r\nher head, Rowan saw her baby sister run her fingers through the little round leaves of the aspen, so green. "Hmmm?"\r\n<p>"I don''t feel much like playing anymore."\r\n<p>Rowan knew that face. She knew that blank stare, the one that was warding off whatever was surfacing in her memory. Her little sister''s chin trembled.\r\n<p>"Come here baby girl," Rowan whispered, and Penny curled up on her lap, tucking her face in the crook of her neck. Rowan held her tight.\r\n<p>They sat there, the two girls and the young trees and the old trees. <p>They stayed until the roots of their legs let go, and they left the park,\r\ncarrying the past in their pockets and under their nails.</p>', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Arbor Day', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),

"Don''t rush it."\r\n<p>As if that were possible in this piece of junk. Moving in the bomb suit is like wading through mud, and almost as fun. I waddle toward a solitary car on the evacuated street. The desert sun beats down onto the pavement. It''s hot as the Devil''s Hell in the suit. I''m practically baking inside the thing.\r\n<p>Other than the reddish dust blowing across the street, there is no movement here. No life. I feel like I''m walking on Mars, the world beyond the suit, some fever dream. All I can hear is my own labored breathing and the crunch of dust beneath my boots.\r\n<p>I lick my chapped lips. "What''s the intel on this thing again?" I ask the captain.\r\n<p>"Unidentified explosive," his voice crackles. "Called in as an anonymous tip yesterday. The caller said it just appeared there overnight. Now we couldn''t get a good look with the drone, so you''ll have to visually ID it yourself. It could be anywhere in or on the vehicle."\r\n<p>"So I''m going in blind," I mutter. "Great..."\r\n<p>"Keep your head clear, Warren," the captain warns. "Just do your job and you''ll make it back ok."\r\n<p>"Yes, sir."\r\n<p>The dream goes on. With every heavy footfall I come closer to the car. It''s a beat up old thing, about as sinister as a kitten if you were just looking at it. But with what I know, it''s become a death trap, a ticking time bomb. The Reaper howling my name.\r\n<p>A cold sweat breaks on my forehead and runs into my eyes, blurring my vision. I stop to rest next to the car.\r\n<p><em>Pine trees loom around me, providing welcome shade in the stifling summer heat. A stream trickles away in the distance, mingling with the songs of birds and the buzz of insects. Noah treads lightly in front of me. "\r\n<p>You know this place, Warren," he says to me over his shoulder. "You''ve been here before."\r\n<p>"I have..." I reply hesitantly. "But I''m still lost. Where are we?"\r\n<p>Noah stops and turns to me, planting his staff in the ground before him. "Tell me where we are."\r\n<p>"I just said I don''t know-"\r\n<p>"You didn''t listen. Tell me where we are." The shaman''s gaze is intent but patient.\r\n<p>I look around and think. "Well, we''re in the forest," I manage. "We''re near some water. And we''ve been walking for a while, so I''d say we''re a good ways in now."\r\n<p>Noah nods. "See? You''re not so lost, are you, Warren?"</p></em>\r\n<br / >\r\n<p>"Warren? Warren!" the captain''s voice again. "What the hell are you doing?"\r\n<p>"Just taking a breather, sir."\r\n<p>A sigh of frustration hisses through my headset. "We don''t got all day. Get your ass in gear!"\r\n<p>"Yeah, er, yes, sir," I stammer. I blink away the sweat from my eyes and focus on the car once more.\r\n<p>With deliberate steps I circle the car to make a visual inspection.\r\nThe sun blazes down on what probably used to be a shiny white paint   job. Most of it has chipped off or darkened to a shade of dirty yellow by now. The metal showing underneath is rusted and warped. I''m surprised this thing can still move. It leans heavily on a flat tire. The whole machine seems to be sagging under its own weight. The windows are all broken.\r\nInside all I see is the ripped, faded upholstery of the seats and a few crushed cans littering the floor. I lower myself down to the pavement and take a look at the undercarriage. A bunch of rusty car guts. Nothing out of the ordinary.\r\n<p>"No visual yet, sir," I report. "It''s not anywhere on the exterior." <p>"Search the interior," orders the captain. "Carefully. We don''t know\r\nthe trigger for this thing yet."\r\n<p>"Yes, sir."\r\n<p>I go to the driver''s side and ease my head through the broken window to check the inside of the door. The suit''s helmet gets stuck half way, but I can see enough to tell there aren''t any obvious devices attached to the door. I pull back out and grip the door handle.\r\n<p>Deep breath. Will this be my last...?\r\n<p>I lift the handle and pull back slowly. The rusty door shrieks in protest, but at least it doesn''t explode.\r\n<p>"Entering the vehicle now," I relay.\r\n<p>A plume of dust flies into the air as I rest my knees on the edge of the driver''s seat. The glove box hangs open crookedly, but all that''s in there are some dusty papers and a few soiled napkins. I duck my head down to look under the two front seats: nothing. The back seats are clean, too. I pop the trunk and find only a spare tire. I pry the car radio from the front console, but even that''s empty.\r\n<p>"It appears to be clean, sir," I say. <p>"Keep looking," he responds.\r\n<p>The captain always was a stubborn son of a bitch. But even he should know that tips like this are bullshit most of the time. Frustrated, hot, and tired, I plop down onto the driver''s seat.\r\n<p>Click!\r\n<p>Oh fuck...\r\n<br />\r\n<p><em>We cross the stream and Noah starts leading me up a steep, wooded incline. The sun has begun to sink in the sky, but there''s still plenty of light left in the day.\r\n<p>After only a few minutes I''m huffing and puffing, each step a grueling challenge. The climb is so steep that sometimes I fall and slide a few feet down, but Noah is always there to help me up and keep me going. The shaman himself seems to glide up the mountain, his movements as graceful and effortless as a crane.\r\n<p>"How... do you... do that?" I ask between breaths as we rest. <p>"Do what?"\r\n<p>"Climb... like that... it''s like... you''re not even... trying." I wipe the sweat from my forehead and peer up at him.\r\n<p>"I do not fight the mountain," he says simply. "You, Warren, you fight the mountain. You struggle with it, teeth bared like a rabid dog. That is not the way. You must go with the mountain, not against it."\r\n<p>I don''t know what the hell that means, and I don''t have time to think about it because we''re off again.\r\n<p>An eternity later, the trees fade away, the sky opens up, and we''re standing on the edge of a sheer cliff facing west. The sun blazes on the horizon, painting cloud and rock alike a deep crimson. At the foot of the cliff lies a lake sparkling in the fading light. A hawk flies past and cries out, soaring toward the sun.\r\n<p>"Woah," I breath.</p></em>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>"Report," the captain''s voice says. I thought Heaven was supposed to\r\nbe paradise. Since when did Saint Peter let overbearing officer''s throughthe Pearly Gates? Maybe I''m in Hell. But didn''t I sacrifice my life for the greater good? Serving the country and all that? Not that getting blown up by some anonymous terrorist''s bomb is particularly heroic, but shouldn''t it count for something?\r\n<p>"Warren, report!" <p>I open my eyes.\r\n<p>I''m still in the car in the desert. <p>Oh. So I didn''t die.\r\n<p>"I think I''ve engaged the bomb, sir," I say shakily. "I sat down in the driver''s seat and heard a click. Probably a pressure mechanism in the seat itself."\r\n<p>A hiss of static comes from the headset. A cold pit of dread settles in my stomach.\r\n<p>"What are my orders, captain?"\r\n"You''re going to have to get out of this one yourself, Warren," the captain states.\r\n<p>"Can''t you send another guy in?" I ask frantically. The fear rises from my stomach into my heart, a jackhammer pounding in my chest. "This thing will explode if I move!"\r\n<p>"We don''t know that," the captain says. "Plus, I can''t risk another one of my men on this op. You''re on your own. If you''re fast enough you''ll be able to get out of the blast radius."\r\n<p>How encouraging. "Yes, sir."\r\n<p>The fear has taken hold of my mind now, raised to a fever pitch of hysteria. Am I going to die? My breathing is so fast and hard now that it clouds the faceplate of the helmet. All I can see is a red haze. I''m rooted to the spot, paralyzed. I''m going to die here, in this fucking desert, because of some stubborn fucker who can''t lead worth two shits. What happened to no man left behind? I''m going to die. A goddamn monkey would make a better officer.\r\n<p>But the monkey''s not in charge, is he?\r\n<p>I''m going to die I''m going to die I''m going to die...\r\n<br />\r\n<p><em>Noah smiles at me and walks to the edge of the cliff. "Come," he beckons, his hand outstretched. As I walk to the edge, he puts his arm over my shoulder and points down toward the water. "That is your destination."\r\n<p>"But we just climbed all the way up here!" I protest. "My knees would\r\nprobably give out on the way down. I need to rest first."\r\n<p>"That is the long way," he says. "There is an easier path." <p>I look at him incredulously. "You mean... Jumping?"  <p>The shaman shakes his head. "Flying."\r\n<p>"You can''t be serious," I chuckle. But when Noah fixes me with his piercing gaze, I know he''s not joking. I wrench free from his grasp and step away from the cliff. "No," I say. "I can''t fly. I don''t know how!"\r\n<p>"You do."\r\n<p>"No, I don''t" I argue. "I don''t have wings, for Christ''s sake!" "It is your spirit that must fly, not your body."\r\n<p>"Oh, this is fucking wonderful," I mutter. "I can''t get away from this bullshit, not even in my daydreams! Fly...Yeah right. How the hell am I supposed to fly?"\r\n<p>"Only you can answer that question," Noah says. He waits by the cliff while I stomp around and curse. After a few minutes I sit down on a rock, defeated.\r\n<p>"I can''t do it," I insist.\r\n<p>"So says every bird before its first flight. Yet every fledgling takes the plunge all the same. They jump with no hope of flight, but fly they do. They conquer their fear and soar."\r\n<p>"So... I just have to jump?"\r\n<p>Noah shrugs. "You could try. But you better hurry. The sun is setting."\r\n<p>He''s right. The light fades from the land. The first stars wink into the night sky. I stand up and walk slowly to the edge of the cliff, peering over the edge. My heart races at the sight. I close my eyes and take a deep breath.\r\n<p>This is crazy. I can''t do this, can I? Throw myself off the edge? But is there any other way? Noah seems to believe in me. Maybe that''s enough. Maybe it''s like he said: conquer my fear.\r\n<p>All I have to do is jump...</p></em>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>"All you have to do is jump, Warren," I say to myself in the car, heart pounding. "All you have to do is jump. All you have to do is jump. All you have to do is jump!"\r\n<p>I roll to my left and push off the car with my hands and feet as hard as I can, landing face-first on the sidewalk.\r\n<p>Click!\r\n<p>Hellfire engulfs me, the deafening explosion ringing in my ears. A shower of debris pelts my back and legs, puncturing the suit and my skin ina few places. A jet of flame shoots above me. Thick, black smoke follows.\r\n<p>But I''m alive!\r\n<p>I roll over onto my back and watch the flaming husk of the car belch smoke into the air. I think of Noah''s smile.\r\n<p><em>"That''s how you fly," he whispers.</p></em>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Leap of faith', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en');

(26, 'Schadenfreude', 'Madison Breiland', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>You watch with a surge of vindictive satisfaction as the sick bastard who killed your son convulses in the electric chair, and your only regret is that you won''t see the fear and pain and desperation carved into his face right before the light fades from his eyes.\r\n<p>Deep brown eyes so much like your son''s that it hurts.\r\n<p>Twenty seconds. There''s less than twenty seconds until the current cuts, until his heart stops and his brain starves itself of oxygen and stutters to a halt. Such a tiny and insignificant stretch of time, really, but it feels like one of the longest and most agonizing moments of your life.\r\n<p>The metal folding chair digs into your back painfully; "just skin and bones", John would say with a fond smile - but you don''t dare shift into a more comfortable position, lest you draw attention to yourself. You can  still feel the piercing stares of the vultures whose sight was set on you the moment you entered the room, whispers filtering through the air - ''It''s them, the parents'' and ''those poor dears'' and ''can''t imagine what they went through''. And suddenly you hate them all, just a little bit more, because   you want this to be real. Not this farce of a play with the stuffy, nicely dressed actors, spewing niceties and vacant promises. Not the politics and regulations that drip like poison from the tongues of the nearby officials.\r\nAnd it is much too muggy this July day, even surrounded by windowless concrete on all sides as you are, but you don''t care. Because you want him to suffer, to have all the pain he has caused inflicted back on him ten-fold. Shove the barrel of John''s shotgun right between his eyes and make him beg for his pitiful excuse for a life. You want him to understand just what your son felt right before that knife was plunged deep into his ribcage and he was left bleeding out in a snow bank.\r\n<p>Because there is something about the waiting. Knowing that death is coming - a silent shadow breathing down your neck like a barely leashed monster. The inevitability of it all that makes it that much more terrifying.\r\n<p>And finally the thrashing has stopped. The leather clamps are removed and a short man in a white coat announces the time of death.\r\n<p>The second hand of the clock ricochets like a gun shot in the following silence. You stare at the dirty utilitarian walls surrounding you on all sides, the steady murmur of the spectator''s voices dying like smothered embers. You don''t move, don''t dare to breathe. Because if you do, you are sure it will shatter this fragile and surreal dream you are in, and you will wake again to an empty heart and mind full of bitter rage.\r\n<p>As you walk through the prison on John''s arm you see stained floors and harsh, flickering fluorescents that cast sinister shadows that follow you through the hallway and out the door. And as you climb into the passenger seat, you feel equal parts nervous excitement and dread; sadistic glee and nausea.\r\n<p>Your husband sighs. His shoulders slump as the tension seeps out of his frame and he leans on the steering wheel, burying head in his hands. It appears as if a monumental weight has been lifted from his mind, leaving him breathless and disoriented, and yet something heavy and constricting has settled like a vice in his heart. And then huge, heaving sobs tear  through his body in a silent torment, and you can''t understand. Why is he crying? Why now? You''ve both shed countless tears for Matthew the past three years. You''ve looked forward to this day for so long, grasped for it like a lifeline. Where the most painful memories could be put to rest and you could finally look at your son''s picture without becoming hysterical.\r\n<p>"Mama, Mama!" A child giggled as you placed your gardening gloves into the grass and swept him up into your arms. He wiggled and escaped, laughing as you chased him into the fields behind the house.\r\n<p>You don''t reach out, keeping your hands clasped tightly in your lap. A lump has nestled itself into your throat. Nothing is said because you can''t think of anything to say.\r\n<p>You think back to the past, when days like this had been sport.\r\nColiseum battles, where the walls had been painted red. Shootouts in the Old West, when a loaded gun stood between today and tomorrow. Public lynching''s in a town square.\r\n<p>Are you truly no better than the Romans, watching as strangers are torn limb from limb and their blood pools on the stone floor? Laughing at the fate of the misfortunate slave who stands shaking in front of a heavily- armored, hulking gladiator with nothing more than a flimsy spear?\r\n<p>You think of how many casualties there have been, how you hadn''t realized how involved this would become - how many lives this would infect - and you hate that part of yourself that isn''t the least bit sorry, because he''s dead. Matthew''s dead. And all for some petty cash and valuables. It wasn''t anything personal, oh no, just a wrong place wrong time sort of situation, but somehow that makes it worse. So much worse, because he died for nothing. Absolutely nothing.\r\n<p>"My family was starving. It was the middle of December, and we were about to be thrown out on the street. Then Tom came to me with a job...\r\nit was just supposed to be the one, easy in and out. Just enough to getby.\r\nWhat was I supposed do?" The man slumped further in his chair and clasped his hands before him. His eyes, which had been darting across the courtroom, finally settled on the questioner''s face. "But then it just... that kid wasn''t s''posed to be there. It went wrong."\r\n<p>After, the guard grabbed his arm and hauled him roughly to his feet.\r\nRight before he was escorted out of the courtroom, he raised his head,   and you can swear that your eyes met. His gaze was solemn, clear, and begging for something that you couldn''t define, yet knew instinctively that you weren''t willing to give. That you couldn''t give. Not with that gapping, bleeding chasm that had taken residence in your chest.\r\n<p>You turned your head away.\r\n<p>Just like the Romans, you think. It is only when John looks over, startled, that you realize you had spoken aloud.\r\n<p>"What?" John asks.\r\n<p>"The Romans," you hear yourself say. Your voice sounds weak and unused. "We''re like them, John, just like them."\r\n<p>He stares at you, eyes puffy and bewildered. "Are... are you feeling alright, hon? Hotter than hell in here, I can turn on the air..." He fumbles with some dials.\r\n<p>Can''t he understand?\r\n<p>"No, I''m fine," you insist. "But John, you''re not listening, you -"\r\n<p>But you stop, because you look at John, truly look. John, whose hair is greying around the edges and hands are creased with lines you don''t remember being there this morning, and you can see that he already knows. Poor, sweet John, who with your sister''s help threw his heart and soul into the case, and at the time the only feeling you could dredge up was a vague sense of relief that he had found a purpose and was no longer sitting semi-catatonic in his armchair, like those first few horrible weeks after.\r\n<p>He knows what humans are like. And he is a much better one than you will ever be.\r\n<p>You remain silent for too long. He takes your hand in his strong calloused one, staring at the intertwined fingers like they hold every secret the two of you have come to possess over the years. He sighs once more, and twists the car keys with his other hand, breaking the temporary silence. "Okay," he says. "Okay. Let''s just get home, hon."\r\n<p>The car trip home is worse than the trip there. It feels like specters have followed you from the prison and have settled into the back seat, whispering to each other of times of then and now and never-will-be.\r\n<p>"The defendant James Clarke has been found guilty..."\r\n<p>Voices erupted from the courtroom in a wave of shouts and cheers. <p>Music drifts from the radio. You can''t think of the name of the song, but it''s familiar, and you hear John hum along to the chorus.\r\n<p>"Where do you think you''re going?" John yelled. John never yelled. <p>"Away from this fucking family!" Matthew slammed the door, the force knocking a family picture from the wall. You picked it up, staring at the cracked glass, and wondered if all teenagers were like this, or if you were just lucky.\r\n<p>You watch from the window as the landscape flies by in a blur of green and gold. The sky doesn''t move, though. It never does. An ocean of constant blue, with turbulent white clouds that glide and twist across their canvas and transform into marvelous creatures and untold ideas that you can only ever see out of the corner of your eye, for when you turn your head to stare at them straight on you see only shapeless blobs.\r\n<p>A mop of unruly chestnut hair peaked through the tall grass. You pretended not to see and continue to call his name, craning your neck and poking your head behind a tree-\r\n<p>-flashes by, and you feel the road shift to gravel beneath the tires. The house comes into view, the chipped white exterior painted shades of orange and pink-purple in the dying light.\r\n<p>The car stills. A hand touches your arm.\r\n<p>"Amelia." You felt John take the plate from your hands, and you realized you were about to set the table for three again. Arms encircled your waist-\r\n<p>-and lead you up the steps of the front porch, past blooming azaleas and daffodils-\r\n<p>-where you stopped and watched as he trudged through the snow in John''s too-large work boots and made his way to the stables. He saw you and waved, and you waved back. It was the last time you saw him smile.\r\n<p>And afterwards when you lie in bed, you attempt to summon some emotion; sympathy, guilt, any shred of compassion that would prove you''re still human. But then you remember your child''s battered body, abandoned like a broken toy in a ditch a few miles north - pale as snow with lifeless, glassy eyes. The family of your son''s killer, a now grieving widow and a six year old daughter with bright blond curls and the sweetest smile you''ve  ever seen, a smile that would never see the light again when her innocence was torn from her as she screamed in her mother''s arms the moment her Daddy was hauled out of the court room. And now you can only smell charred flesh and urine, can only see the guard pull the black hood over his face and pull the switch, again and again.\r\n<p>You feel your husband''s salty tears as he holds you close and whispers words of forgiveness on that poor man''s soul, and all you feel is hollow inside.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Schadenfreude', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
(27, 'Startup Blog', 'L.B. Thomas', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>Day 1: We''re off and running!!! We spent all day setting up the office: Mindy painted the walls, Josh got some futuristic desk chairs from Staples (to help with our posture), and I''ve been doing the social networking thing (It''s the future of business, people!) We haven''t picked out a name for our startup yet, but as soon as we do, we''re going to print-up some bad-ass\r\nT-shirts for all of our investors! It seems like it took us soooo long to get this thing off the ground. We''re just super stoked to be making our crazy dreams into a reality! And make some $$$ too!!! Check back here often cus we''re going to keep everyone updated on the progress!</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 3: Alright people, are you as stoked as we are to get this whole thing rolling?!? Here''s a little background on our startup for the people who just stumbled onto this blog. We''re three awesome friends who decided, hey, we like to hang together, why not work together?!? But no office, 9 to 5 BS for us. F@#% THAT! <- Sorry Grandma ;) We''re going  to start our own company where we can, you know, take a day off to go kayaking or whatever. Corporate work KILLS creativity. New Marketing,\r\ndynamic work environments, and solid internet social outreach is going to help us DISTROY those old dinosaurs. <pterodactyl sound> Later Startup Blogopiles...</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 5: Another awesome day! We''ve been throwing around name ideas all morning and we have it narrowed down to three: infoLearn, LearnTech, and L.E.A.R.N. where each letter stands for a word (Learn Entertain Arts... we''ll figure the rest out later!) We definitely want "learn" in the title. We''re all about people educating themselves about what''s happening in the world. Knowledge. Anyhow, tweet your favorite name with the tag #StartUpInTheAir... that''s right, we''re doing it by vote, American Idol style... lates!</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 8: We picked the name out B!@#CHES! Right now, you''re reading a post from the co-founder of LearnTech! Hell yeah! We already have some wicked logo ideas! Here''s the secret to our success: We have the best people for the job! Mindy is a graphic designer, Josh is also a graphic designer, and I have a 2X major in architecture and graphic design. We have this logo shizle nailed down! The way you sell product is with good marketing, and the best marketing is to have a badass Lo-Go. This is too easy. The only thing left to do is decide what our product is going to be. If you have any ideas, send ''m my way - use my FB email, I check that more often.\r\nL8R!</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 13: Pool party! We have a big yard behind the office so we thought, you know, LET''S GET A FUCKING POOL! If you have Josh''s #, you should ring him up for directions. We''re going to be here all day. Whenever I hear people complain about their jobs, I just start laughing. Later suckers...</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 15: We decided on a product, <drum roll>, we''re going to make software to teach people how to read body language. It''s going to be like Rosetta Stone, but for body language. And we''re going to have apps and all that sh!t. We figured that we have "learn" is in the title, so it totally makes sense. All we have to do is hire a couple of nerds to write the code... shhh, maybe they''re reading right now... and then we let these three genius do their work. This is going to be huge.</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 18: We have our first application for the "engineer" position. I hate to have to bring someone else on so early in the game, but I guess if none of us want to learn how to make programs, we have to go this route. They''re just nerds though, right? We should be able to pay them with Mountain Dew. In OTHER news, Mindy just had the awesomest idea today. We''re going to throw a LearnTech music festival!!! More info to come. Stay tuned...</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 20: We finalized the logo. It is So. Bad. Ass. LearnTech: Professional Software Solutions. I really want to put the logo on this blog, but I can''t figure out how to post any pictures on here. Do I need to do something with HTML? None of us are computer people... we have lives... But if you know how to post a picture on a blog like this, you should email me. I want to show everyone sooo bad.</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 23: We interviewed some people for the "engineer" position. Wow, those guys wanted a lot of money. Like, a LOT of money. They wanted more then we make. Sorry nerds, if you want the big bucks, you have to be a creative. If they don''t want in, then their loss. We''re going to keep looking, but in the \r\nmeantime... POOL PARTY!</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 27: Lame ass. Apparently there''s already a company called LearnTech, and their lawyers are DICKS. They told us that we can''t use LearnTech OR LearnTec without the h. We don''t want to have to re-do the graphic work, so our only option is to change the name to LarnTech and squish out the e. Oh well, I still think it''s a cool name. Now it''s a name with a story. When people ask, "What does that mean?", we can be like, well, we got a cease and desist order and whatever. It''s kind of a funny story, I guess.</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 32: Mindy''s been booking bands for the LarnTech festival for like two weeks, and now they''re all like, "We want guaranteed money up front". When did music become all about the money, guys? That''s so disappointing.</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 45: The bank said they won''t give us any money. What the fuck? They said that we wasted 20k of our independent investor''s money creating one worthless logo. How can they say that? Have then even seen the logo?!? They were just rude. Are they allowed to talk to people like that? They don''t know us.</p>\r\n<p>#</p>\r\n<p>Day 51: Well, Josh bailed. He was being all pissy about the fact that his aunt was our biggest investor. If this company fails, it will be because SOME people didn''t believe in us enough to see it through to the end. It''s not about the money.

(28, 'The Woman and The Man', 'Josh Mazzoni', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>On an unseasonably warm day early in February, a boy walked along an east facing sidewalk in a small city''s business district. The street, Main Street, was lined by buildings no more than five stories tall in which coffee shops, western-wear stores, restaurants and markets resided among other things. Although the boy was to be comfortably considered a man by age, one would be strictly compelled-if based on nothing more than his demeanor in the months preceding this day-to consider him a boy. He was purely an average boy, possessed of an apparent slump in his shoulders and a subtle jaw line. His eyes were deep and blue, and they were weary for reasons that cannot be known. His one feature capable of soliciting attention was his hair. He wore it past his ears and brushed it behind and to the left side of his forehead. It was brown and wavy and wild so that any girl who walked past turned their neck back around to glimpse its owner another time.</p>\r\n<p>He walked by people and buildings that, although he had seen before, he was always able to find a new interest in. He walked down Main Street many times, always on the East-facing sidewalk and never the West. Each time, with the road on his left side and when the buildings ended and the pedestrians were less, the boy turned right onto the last street and returned home through the park. The more he walked this route, the more things that seemed to change. The buildings were continually infiltrated by new shoppers, and those passing on the sidewalk were rarely the ones from before. On each walk the street was neither the same nor different-it had merely matured.</p>\r\n<p>The boy looked around at the people passing. A man dressed in business attire laughed into his earpiece. A woman rushed from the lobby  of her hotel into a cab. A child held the hands of his parents and swung back and forth as they held him barely above the concrete. The child smiled the way we all used to when we held our parents'' hands. It was refreshing for the boy to see all these things as he walked.\r\n<p>Looking ahead of him now, a woman caught his eye. She was a woman for whom a man removes his cap. For whom a man pulls out her seat. For whom a man holds the door-not just on the first or second encounter, but every time. And she was looking dead at the boy.\r\n<p>Not sure of what to do, he glanced toward the ground. The ground, however, never appealed much to the boy and he quickly sought a different view. Looking around at an unnaturally fast pace, he desperately attempted to avoid eye contact. He looked left and looked right; he repeated this process too many times. For a brief second every few steps, he glanced in front of him to see where the woman''s gaze lied. Her gaze met his each  of four times. When the woman was a block and a half away from the boy, he became noticeably nervous and flushed in the face. Not so flushed that anyone could notice, but flushed to the point that he was uncomfortably sure that a beautiful woman walking by would.</p>\r\n<p>The woman, the beautiful woman, wore a low-cut tie-dyed t-shirt covered by an open leather jacket. She wrapped her long, slender legs in black skinny jeans that eventually gave way to a pair of black high heels. She had fair skin and perfectly smeared red lipstick. Her green eyes both threatened and comforted those lucky enough to look into them. Her hair was brunette, worn long and straight, and she carried herself as though she understood the magnitude of her being.</p>\r\n<p>Eyes jutting from one corner to the other of his sockets, and the woman finally on the same block as the boy, he quickly realized he would have to carry himself in a manner presentable to a woman of such stature. Instinctively, he straightened his back and lifted his head. He looked unflinchingly forward and into the eyes of the woman walking toward him.\r\nHe felt both threatened and comforted. He was nervous but did not dare  to show it. As the woman walked closer, the ends of his lips curled into a smile and he removed his winter cap. His head began to twist left, as his eyes were still set on hers. It was soon apparent however, that as she passed she was not looking at him, rather through him. It cannot be said when  she stopped gazing at him, if ever she had begun, but she certainly wasn''t looking at the boy the way he was looking at her now.</p>\r\n<p>The boy was surprised that the woman had looked away. Still, he was certain that she had been looking to him until just before they crossed paths and that maybe she saw in him something rarely seen. Or perhaps  it was he who saw this thing in her. He was unsure. He thought on these things as she walked away.</p>\r\n<p>Having now passed by the boy, the woman looked ahead without wavering. She walked confidently forward never taking the time to see where she was heading. And as she walked away from the boy, he couldn''t help but to follow her with his eyes. He stopped in order to steal one more glimpse of her, then another and another. He was turned around on the sidewalk, still for a minute or more.</p>\r\n<p>Without so much as looking before she entered the road, the woman crossed onto the block the boy had just been walking on. In the same manner, she turned immediately right to cross Main Street. Luckily, as she stepped into the road the orange hand across the street turned into a white man walking-though she certainly never noticed.\r\n<p>If she had bothered even once to take notice of her surroundings, she would have seen men in three separate cars captivated by her looks and by her style as she passed in front of each of them. When she was on the opposite sidewalk heading west, away from the boy, the light turned green and one car went forward. The other three remained for some seconds, before horns started sounding, stopped behind the crosswalk following the woman attentively with their eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Had she looked back the woman also would have noticed hoards of men, and some women, captivated by her looks, by her style, by her grace. Many people turned their heads and others stopped completely. There were men with wives and families who were tempted to look back but never did. Still, most everyone noticed this woman.</p>\r\n<p>Still in awe over the beautiful woman, the boy stood staring back   at her even after she was a few blocks away; long after most of the others\r\nresumed walking. Then, not knowing how or why, and not by any will of his own, he escaped his standing position and, cap in hand, ran toward the woman. Sprinted toward the woman. Sprinted in the direction he always came from and never went to. Sprinted down this ever-changing street with his eyes pointed unfalteringly toward the woman. He dashed across the street while drivers jammed on their brakes and blared their horns. He didn''t flinch, rather he kept sprinting. And by all of those still captivated  by the woman, and even by those who were no longer, it was surely understood why this man, this man, was running.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Rite of passage', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),

Aaron was an avid writer and a great lover of language. We invite you to join us in celebrating the work of a writer who had far too few opportunities to share his work.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I''ve been watching sand fall through mom''s old hourglass kitchen timer. Nothing is being timed, but I like the way the sand trickles through the aperture and collects into a tidy mass at the bottom. The grains slide passed each other with such ease, reminding me that not everything is as it seems to be, that sometimes solid things might behave like liquids, and vice versa. The sand that''s falling, that same sand has measured countless hours. Now the sand is so worn by friction that the hourglass has become more of a 53-minutes glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom used to use the hourglass for everything. One day she watched the sand fall, counting seconds-one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four...- until she marked increments for virtually any amount of time imaginable. She preferred the hourglass to watching the clock, and she still used it even when digital timers became standard. I once watched her flip the hourglass 5 times when she was cooking a 20 pound turkey on Thanksgiving. "I bought you a digital timer, so you wouldn''t have to stand at attention for this outdated timer, mom," I told her. With fingertips on the glass, eyes fixed on the falling sand, she watched the last grain fall and promptly flipped it. "Four more flips," she said.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>I remember that was the first Thanksgiving I spent with both mom and dad since he got out of prison. Dad spent 8 years in the clink for cooking and selling meth, a powder that held dad''s attention with as much force as the hourglass did for mom. He had heaping piles of that stuff when I was growing up. He''d rail lines off the kitchen countertop with a dollar bill. A maelstrom of dust would swirl up through the rolled dollar bill and disappear. "Mom''s counting time, and I''m controlling it," he said. "With a little bit of this stuff, I make time fly. And she calls herself a cook." He had me propped up on his knee. Mom was cooking casserole, trying to figure out which increment on her hourglass corresponded to 27 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When dad got arrested, the police confiscated his glassware. One of the cops dropped his Erlenmeyer flask, and it broke into about a thousand tiny shards. Mom swept it into a neat little pile. Dad was gone, but I imagined him snorting the pile, making it all disappear. Mom set the hourglass for 8 years and awaited his return. I remember seeing the same trickling powder when I started working with dad. We were at a commercial masonry job in Escondido. Dad and I were the only white guys on the crew. The rest of the guys were from Tijuana. They called me Brown Boy because the dust from the dried tan mortar would mix with my sweat and form a flaky brown layer over my skin. I''d smile, and my face would be cracked mud. Even on days when it was 108 degrees, they didn''t sweat. They were used to the heat. There were big silos containing dry mortar on the jobsite. That''s where I saw the trickling powder. The old man of the crew, Sergio, would mix  mud all day. Sometimes I''d watch him from the scaffolding. All day long,  all he had to do was pull levers. He''d pull a lever, and the dry mortar would fall through the opening of the silo into the mixer. Then he''d pull another lever to empty the contents of the mixer into a big rectangular container, which he''d then convey to the scaffolding with a forklift, operated by more levers. I''d stock 30-pound block and run myself ragged at the behest of about 15 prima donna masons. Each one of them demanded a different consistency of mortar: They''d say, "How the fuck am I supposed to lay block with this panther piss?" or "Brown Boy, this mud is too dry! Shake it up!" or "I couldn''t butter a slice of toast with this damn mud!" I''d think of Sergio pulling levers, the dust falling, and I''d long to be in his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a particularly hot day, when I was wishing I was Sergio, we ran  out of mud. We were all feeling the push to get the job done and got caught up in the chaos. From the side of the building we were working on, the mixing station wasn''t visible, so the masons sent me over to give Sergio the business. I no longer wished to be Sergio after that.\r\nSergio lay face first in the container full of mortar, his entire head and shoulders submerged. I tried to pull him out by his pant legs, but  the mortar had hardened around him. I told the crew, and we all, grimy with sweat and dirt, stood in a half-circle tableau around the old man.\r\nThe jobsite shut down early that day. Later when we were back to work, I asked Raul what happened. He put his fist to his chest and said one word: "Coraz&oacuten."\r\nMom''s coraz&oacuten gave out on her a few years later, just stopped beating. One of the effects of long-term meth use is premature heart failure. Turns out dad wasn''t the only one controlling time. "You wanna know the best way to make 8 years go really fast?" mom had said. "Hide the hourglass."\r\nMom was cremated, so I put her ashes in a big empty hourglass. I watched mom fall through the aperture and wondered what it would be like if we all had a visible hourglass measuring our lives. I wondered if I''d ever see mom again and how long I''d have to wait if I would. I hid that hourglass and never looked at it again.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Hourglass', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
(30, 'Little Boy and Brown Bear', 'Aaron Plowman', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p>In illo tempore, when miracles still happened, when you could look forward with prophetic clarity and see the great moving gears of the world and know just how things would end, a boy left his cabin in the woods, seeking immortality. The boy was an only child and preternaturally ugly.  He received his looks from his father, a woodsman of sorts who engraved likenesses in tree trunks. Their cabin was isolated, so the only likenesses he could produce were their own. You could find their ugly mugs inscribed on about every tree within a 20-mile radius of their humble dwelling.</p>\r\n<p>Before the boy left home, he said to his father, "I fear not, for I will not be alone. Your image will accompany me everywhere I go."</p>\r\n<p>His father whittled as the boy spoke. "Look into the glass," his father said. "Tell me what you see."</p>\r\n<p>The boy looked through the window, saw the lush, creeping wilderness, and said, "I see trees."</p>\r\n<p>"I said the glass. You''re missing something, boy," said he. "Go and find\r\nit."</p>\r\n<p>The boy set out with a knapsack containing 3 items: a bone-handle knife, a loaf of bread, and a vial of poison. He navigated the dense woods in search of a trail, scraping passed branches, trudging through thick brush.\r\nShafts of sunlight stole through the heavy canopy, affording him some visibility to find his way. He marched on until nightfall, and in the deep black of the forest, he cut a slice of bread from his loaf and ate the bread ravenously. Then he rested his head on his knapsack and drifted off to sleep.</p>\r\n<p>The boy was awakened by a rustling not far off from his position. He peered through the dark and saw a little glowing orb of light dancing in the darkness. He thought it a will-o''-the-wisp, so he gathered his belongings and set off after the light. He was soon upon it and found that it was not\r\na will-o''-the-wisp at all. He saw before him a mighty brown bear with a lantern in hand.</p>\r\n<p>"Brown Bear," said the boy. "Why do you carry a light? I know it to be true that all bears can see at night."</p>\r\n"Because I am blind in the dark. A man carved out my eyes as if they were bark."</p>\r\n<p>"I''m searching for the trail," said the boy. "Can you help me?" </p>\r\n<p>"Ay," said Brown Bear, "it is the trail I seek."</p>\r\n<p>Brown Bear led the way, the boy following close behind. Shortly along\r\nthe journey, Brown Bear stopped suddenly. "The company I keep, I must be able to see. Let me touch your face or else I will flee"</p>\r\n<p>Brown Bear reached out with clawing paws and searched the air for the boy. The boy met his paws with his face. Brown Bear mashed his paws against the boy''s face, feeling over every detail of the boy''s flesh.</p>\r\n<p>"My you are an ugly boy, but ugliness is a mark of virility. You need not be coy."</p>\r\n<p>They continued on until Brown Bear came to another sudden halt. "I believe there to be a marker on one of the trees nearby." He began groping at the trees, trying to find the right one to lead them to the trail. During his groping, he chanced upon one of the woodsman''s engravings.</p>\r\n<p>"This tree bears the image of the one who blinded me. I''ve felt it, and how clearly do I see. You are the child of the man who carved my eyes. You will pay dearly. You will pay for his lies."</p>\r\n<p>The boy slipped Brown Bear''s grasp and fled from his presence, his shoulders bouncing off of trees, limps scratching at his face. Soon he was running in a great empty space and realized he was on the trail. There the dark was lighter. He was able to see by the light of the waxing moon. For fear of Brown Bear''s pursuit, he continued on without rest.</p>\r\n<p>He traveled until sunrise, and in the dust-speckled light of dawn, he could see that the trees no longer bore the mark of his father. He initially felt fear, but soon the fear transformed into comfort. The marks on his face had made him even uglier. He felt it a rite of passage.</p>\r\n<p>He walked until he reached a fork in the trail. There, where the  trail branched, stood an evergreen tree with a man nailed to the trunk. His hands, overlapped, reached to the heavens with a single metal stake driven through both of them. He was naked save for a loincloth clinging to his emaciated hips. The boy approached him and, with his bone-handle knife, inscribed a message on his chest. It read, "Place me in a cold, dark dwelling, roll over it a stone. Three days'' light the darkness quelling, and then I''ll take my throne."</p>\r\n<p>The boy took no time to admire his work before setting off down the right path. In the distance, he saw a beautiful girl with dark brown hair.\r\nHer beauty only increased as he approached her. "Little girl," said he, "what are you doing all alone."</p>\r\n<p>"I am waiting, boy, for the king to take his throne. I was encased inside a bear, you see, but I have been set free. Years ago, I saw 2 snakes entwined and sundered them with care. I learned that they were vines, and then I was a bear. This day, I formed the vines into a braid, and again I am a maid."</p>\r\n<p>"You must help me," said he. "Let me drink this vial, then stake me to a tree. An inch will bear a mile, and then I''ll be your king."</p>\r\n<p>The boy drank the poison and died at the girl''s feet. She staked him  to a tree and left. Days later, she returned and found a man staked to a tree with an inscription on his chest. She was obedient to the message, and in 3 days'' time, he became her king.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Fairy tale', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
(31, 'Patagonian Promises', 'Lea Brayton', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<p><em>Editor''s Note: This piece is a work of creative non-fiction.</em></p>\r\n<p>I pulled the bleached bone from the deep red dirt- warm in my hands in the midst of a Patagonian summer- and fingered the smooth junctions of lost life. In front of me, all around me, the setting sun blazed her signal of an ending day onto the hazy landscape of the mountains. Their peaks bled down into grassy plains, filling the great river that carved canyons through the landscape. I felt the earth shift beneath me as somewhere in the endless distance herds of guanacos galloped away from snarling pumas in the world''s wildest place.</p>\r\n<p>* This is Patagonia.</p>\r\n<p>I had to keep reminding myself, this is it. I had woken up this morning, warm in my familiar mummy bag, to an overcast sky. My hopeful side overcame my natural pessimism, thinking, perhaps, it was just early and the sunshine wanted a few more hours before making an appearance. My bag had been returned to its stuff sack, the tent poles broken down  and hanging heavy again from my worn pack, yet rain still settled on the horizon tucked back behind the closest mountain face- waiting for me to start today''s 15kms to La Confluencia, the collision of three rivers; the Nef, running from the West, the Cochrane, entering from the North, both flood into the powerful current of the Baker, her ancestral waters heading South for another 170km.</p>\r\n<p>The Baker enters Chile from the Argentinian boarder, just above Cochrane, and flows due west over the Careterra Austral, the only road in all of Southern Patagonia, until pitching nearly 90 degrees at the\r\nConfluencia and carving canyons directly through until she spills out into the fjords of the Pacific Ocean. She is the longest and most powerful river in all of Chile, and I''d been following her flow on foot, walking the length of the great river from entrada to exito before she is damed, and changed forever.</p>\r\n<p>The ominous clouds began dripping just as I arrived at a barbed wire fence, separating me and my river. I raised my pack over my head, feeling the strength I''d gained in 20 days with my life on my back, and threw it over the barrier. This was private land, owned by HidroAysen- the Spanish run, Italian funded hydroelectric energy company who hold the privatized water rights to Chile''s Baker River. This ''Golaith'' had just passed a proposal to build five dams in Chilean Patagonia, providing energy to run the Copper mines in the North. Having known the beauty of the Baker, the idea of her ecosystem forever changed disturbed something deep in the pockets of my heart, and before doubt could corrupt passion, I found myself, alone, climbing over 7 feet of barbed wire, descending to the Confluencia, Dam Site #2.</p>\r\n<p>* 12/8/13 Dia Viente</p>\r\n<p>There''s a certain silence shared by the three rivers, the wind and  the dusk as they collide into each other- as if they have a pact to keep still or keep consistent for just so long- until the stars can peek out and soak this world in their grand silence. The sky is a bright map of inviting constellations tonight, projecting their strength and assurance to every hopeless wanderer who care to look up in awe at the dark hours of the\r\nnight, and find hope in a blackened sky. I have not found the moon the past few nights, who has been such a bright and faithful guide on my Northern excursions. Maybe she will make her comforting appearance tonight, to keep me safe by the water''s edge. It''s not the rivers raging current, or the pumas creeping in the dark, or the illegality of tonight''s campsite that I fear... it''s tomorrow, knowing the river is one day closer to an unfortunate fate. The river is murmuring me to sleep now, a whispering lullaby under the stars.</p>\r\n<p>* 12/9/13 Dia Viente Uno</p>\r\n<p>Today is a much different day than yesterday- the air has a quiet and peaceful breeze- clouds drifting quickly away to let the sunshine spread  her warmth along the land. I''m eating my breakfast of a sliced up, slightly rotten apple and cold instant oatmeal with a mug of hot coffee- boiled with water I borrowed from the colliding rivers- atop a rock at the mouth of the South fork, the Cochrane, looking over the Baker. I think even if I spent a lifetime looking at her waters, I would never stop being in awe of her color. The blue is such a pure, cystaline shade, like no river I''ve ever seen. And for this reason alone I don''t understand why her rarity must be ruined. Why do men always feel the need to own the world?</p>\r\n<p>*</p>\r\n<p>As I sat there, having borrowed water from her banks to nourish myself, to cleanse, to sustain my own life- I knew to keep the precious balance of this karmic place, that I owed the Baker something in return. So, I made her a promise. I gently knelt on her rocky banks and dipped my hands into her turquois current, letting her water run like smooth veins   on my skin, and swore that I would never stop fighting for her freedom. I would do everything I could to keep Goliath off these banks, and let her water run free to meet the ocean as it always has, and always should. I would speak for the voiceless. I would share her natural force with hope  in a world that could see past the commodification, past themselves, to respect what we cannot control. The Baker will remain sin represas, that is my promise.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>* 12/20/13 (at the fjords of the Pacific)</p>\r\n<p>There are things in life that exist purely, elements much stronger than humans can comprehend. We think with our machines and our needs, that we can justify and control what is wild. We are building a broken world\r\nwe will regret, self-destructive when our brash actions leave our children thirsting and at war. Voy a Volver.</p>\r\n<p>*</p>\r\n<p>My fingers grazed the bone I''d found, dried out and cracking from the sun. This was a part of life, this loss. Some die for a purpose, and some just fade; all that''s left over the hollow skeleton of a once thriving place.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Patagonia Sin Represas', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),

The sun is so bright now that the ink on these pages is harsh, and hard to look at. I didn''t even bother to dress, and I''m sitting up on this balcony in the same jeans from yesterday that crashed and rose from bed still slung on my hips. My breasts are wild and untamed, covered only by a worn blue flannel and wisps of unwashed hair pulled free from my ponytail by the seaside wind. I feel dirty and warm, and calm and full and pensive. The sun is shining down from directly above me and today, I''ve seen something in the waves of little colored houses that I hadn''t noticed before. Almost entirely in front of me as I sit with the water to my right and the tourists to my left is a terrace with a white banistered lookout, an exact match to the one I''m defacing by using as my seat. It''s perched on top of a smaller cerro than my Alegre, with bare rock exposing its crude foundation. As I look at it now, I feel as if it''s just appeared. How could I have never noticed, for the hundreds of times I''ve climbed up to this very spot, and stared for hours at the landscape? There are tree preserved there, marking the highest point of the plaza, rivaled only by the proud red, white and blue of the Chilean flag wrestling the wind spitting at the sea. There''s a building with an orange copper roof blinking against the shiny sun, and a blond couple walks lost in each other along its perimeter. It bothers me that the railing is the same, as if mine becomes less real because of the existence of a duplicate. I don''t have time to pursue this thought further before my head is interrupted by the arrival of an old friend.</p>\r\n<p>I hadn''t seen him in over a month, except maybe from a distance just yesterday, straying around one of the farthest corners in the city, as if he was headed out of this salted place. But now, here he is, bathed in sunlight before my very eyes. He looks skinner than the last time I really saw\r\nhim, but he wears the same goofy expression that always covers his small face. His coat looks filthy, speckled with small stains and absurd patches where skin''s exposed. Despite this, he looks at me, happy, so I don''t worry. Before I can manage to get out more than a "Hey, Buddy", he collapses to the ground, his head resting cockeyed toward the South American sun. I thought it better, perhaps, to let him rest a while before catching up. So I slip down off of the railing, and fold myself next to him on the concrete with respective distance. I close my eyes and tip my face to the sun as he does, and let my head navigate the mysterious plaza that shows up three months into my contemplations. I can hear the gulls and the sea crying as if an afterthought, and the city roars with them, in harmony with the rise and fall of the hairy chest of my sleeping streetwalker.</p>\r\n', '', 'Unpublished Works', 'Prose', 'Flag of Chile', '', 'prose', NULL, 'Montana State University (MSU)', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '2015-02-07 18:23:24', '2015-02-02T01:43:19Z', '1.0', 'Student literary journal', 'en'),
